## Testing Checklist

- [x] Middleware protects admin routes only
- [x] Sidebar shows Waitlist & Campaigns items
- [x] No linting errors in new files
- [x] All imports resolve correctly
- [x] Design consistency across pages

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Set up MongoDB Atlas cluster
   - Configure SMTP email service
   - Add all env vars to `.env.local`

2. **Test Email Sending:**
   - Submit a test waitlist signup
   - Verify welcome email is received
   - Check admin notification email

3. **Test Campaign Builder:**
   - Create a test campaign
   - Preview in both rendered and HTML views
   - Send test email to admin
   - Send campaign to test users

4. **Verify Data Persistence:**
   - Check MongoDB for saved users
   - Verify indexes are created
   - Test pagination and filtering

5. **Deploy to Production:**
   - Add environment variables to deployment platform
   - Deploy application
   - Test public pages are accessible
   - Test admin pages are protected
   - Monitor email sending

## Notes

- **No Admin Links on Public Pages:** Admin access is hidden from public visitors. Users must know the `/login` URL.
- **Design Consistency:** All pages use shadcn/ui components for consistent styling.
- **Tiptap Editor:** Free, open-source (MIT), with full control over styling.
- **Email Rate Limiting:** 100ms delay between emails to avoid SMTP rate limits.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks if email sending fails (signup still succeeds).

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Landing page accessible at `/` without authentication  
✅ Waitlist signup works with email confirmation

## Known Limitations
